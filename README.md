Introduction
In today's fast-paced world, travelers demand convenience, efficiency, and reliability when planning their trips. The Travel Hub Booking Website addresses these needs by offering a unified platform where users can search, compare, and book travel services with ease. The website integrates multiple services into a single interface, reducing the complexity and time involved in planning a trip.

The project encompasses both front-end and back-end development, utilizing a range of technologies to deliver a rich and responsive user experience. The front end employs HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface. The back end is powered by PHP and MySQL, ensuring robust data management and secure transaction processing.

Detailed Description
Front-End Development
The front-end development focuses on creating an interactive and responsive user interface. The following technologies are used:

HTML5: Provides the structural foundation of the website, using semantic elements for better accessibility and SEO.
CSS3: Handles the styling of the website, ensuring a consistent look and feel across all devices. Media queries are used to achieve responsiveness.
JavaScript: Enhances interactivity and provides dynamic content updates. Features like form validation, AJAX requests, and interactive filters are implemented using JavaScript.

Back-End Development
The back-end development ensures that the website's functionality is robust and secure. The following technologies are used:

PHP: A server-side scripting language used to handle form submissions, session management, and server-side logic. PHP scripts interact with the database to retrieve and store data.
MySQL: A relational database management system used to store all travel-related data, including user accounts, bookings, payment records, and service details. The database schema is designed to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.
